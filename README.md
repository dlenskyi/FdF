This project is about creating a simplified graphic "wireframe" ("fils de fer" in french, hence the name of project) <br /> representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. <br />
The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to my program. <br />
